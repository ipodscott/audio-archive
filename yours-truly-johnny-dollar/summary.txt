Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar was a radio drama of "the transcribed adventures of the man with the action-packed expense account" â€” America's fabulous freelance insurance investigator. Each Johnny Dollar story started with a phone call from an insurance executive, calling on Johnny to investigate an unusual claim.<br /><br />Each story required Johnny to travel to some distant locale, usually within the United States but sometimes abroad, where he was almost always threatened with personal danger in the course of his investigations.
